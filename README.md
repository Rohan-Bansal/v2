# Rohan Bansal | v2

The second iteration of my personal website, built with Bootstrap and HTML/CSS/JS. 

In my opinion, the site still needs a bit of work, so consider it under active development.



## Libraries Used

- Slick.js
- Particles.js
- Typeit.js
- Bootstrap.js



Anyone can go ahead and fork this for their own usage, just remember to credit me if put up publicly :smile:.
